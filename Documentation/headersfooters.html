				<div class="alert-box notice"><span>Notice: </span>We plan to improve upon the customization of the header and footer in the future, just give us time.</div>
				<p> At the moment, SimpleFrame doest allow such great customisation of your Headers and Footers except from the colour scheme inside style.css, we plan to change this in the future and with your support through GitHub. <p>
				<p> To insert headers and footers, we inserted custom header and footer tags. Inside of your header you div class the title that you would like, simple. In the footer just mashing the keyboard should be enough as no special styling is required and style.css should sort it out. Soon we plan to add a Social Media icon footer.</p>
				<p> You can also edit the font, both the ones we use are from Google; Open Sans and Shadows into the light. All you need to do is import the font files into the style.css and change the font-family: tag. </p>
				<p> If you go to the resource file and select the CSS code for creating a navbar, you can also set up a website navigation system that is easy to use and simple to set up. We are also planning to make this customizable for example; colours, size and width. </p>
