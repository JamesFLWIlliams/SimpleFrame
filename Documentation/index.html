				<p> The SimpleFrame project is a project aimed to make it easier than ever before to be able to code and develop your own website. It uses simple CSS and HTML code chunks making it easier than ever to copy and paste the code into your project. And the greatest feature of SimpleFrame you ask? The fact that it is released under the MIT license. </p>
				<p> This documentation aims to get you familiar with how to develop your first website using SimpleFrame (As easy as the name suggests) and can be for a complete beginner or for a complete developer wanting to release a quick website. </p>
